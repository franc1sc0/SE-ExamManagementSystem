% Software system attributes

The requirements in this section specify the required attributes of performance,
security, and maintainability of the Exam Management System.

\subsubsection{Performance}

The computational and database resources needed for the application are minimal,
and thus a responsive system should be expected. All database calls should be
completed in under a second as long as the server the application is on is not
under a heavy load. Any user visualizations should be updated or presented
within a second as well given the server's overall availability.

\subsubsection{Security}

The application is designed under the assumption that each faculty or student
maintains their username and password in a secure manner. The login function
will allow only valid users access to the appropriate functionality within the
application. Hence, one student should not be able to use the application as
another student or faculty. Because the application will be run on a server,
its overall security is dependant on the server itself and is outside of the
scope of this document.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

The design and implementation of the application should be done in such a way
that maintainability is easy to extend and refine. This is achieved by a
modular design using commercial, freely-available tools to implement the
application. Test environments should be built for the application to help with
the maintenance of the code and functionality.
