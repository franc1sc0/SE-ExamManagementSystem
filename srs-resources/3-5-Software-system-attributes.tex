% Software system attributes

See \ref{constraints} for software system attributes.

% The requirements in this section specify the required attributes
% \index{attributes!requirements} of performance,
% security, and maintainability of the Exam Management System.
% 
% \subsubsection{Performance} \index{performance}
% 
% The computational and database resources needed for the application are minimal,
% and thus a responsive system should be expected. All database calls should be
% completed in under a second as long as the server the application is on is not
% under a heavy load. Any user visualizations should be updated or presented
% within a second as well given the server's overall availability.
% 
% \subsubsection{Security} \index{security}
% 
% The application is designed under the assumption that each Faculty or Student
% maintains their username and password in a secure manner. The login function
% will allow only valid users access to the appropriate functionality within the
% application. Hence, one Student should not be able to use the application as
% another Student or Faculty. Because the application will be run on a server,
% its overall security is dependant on the server itself and is outside of the
% scope of this document.
% 
% \subsubsection{Maintainability} \index{maintainability}
% 
% The design and implementation of the application should be done in such a way
% that maintainability is easy to extend and refine. This is achieved by a
% modular design using commercial, freely-available tools to implement the
% application. Test environments should be built for the application to help with
% the maintenance of the code and functionality.
