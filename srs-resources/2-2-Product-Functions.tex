   \subsubsection{\large Create Exams} \index{exam!create}
   \begin{boxed} % Boxed section
      \textbf{Description:}
      {\small This function allows a Faculty member to create programming and
         communication exams. After creation, the exam is viewable by the
         Students. The exam information includes the exam type, exam

   Students}

            \item The exam data is saved. }
