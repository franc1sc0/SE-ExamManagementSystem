\subsection{Faculty Functionality}
The following is functionality that applies to Faculty.

   \subsubsection{\large Create Exams} \index{exam!create}
   \begin{boxed} % Boxed section
      \textbf{Description:}
      {\small This function allows a Faculty member to create programming and
         communication exams. After creation, the exam is viewable by the
         Students. The exam information includes the exam type, exam
         administration date, start and end time of exam, semester offered,
         location of exam, and registration deadline.} \\

      \textbf{Sequence of Actions:}
      \begin{enumerate}
            {\small
         \item Faculty provides the data for the exam to be created.
         \item The exam is created.
         \item Faculty and Student can see exam.}
      \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Rational:}
      {\small Because the Faculty administer and grades the exams, he or she should
      be the one capable of creating an exam.}
   \end{boxed} % End boxed section

   \subsubsection{\large View Registered Students in Exam} \index{exam!view registered
   Students}
   \begin{boxed} % Boxed section
      \textbf{Description:}

         Students for an exam. The information displayed includes username,
         Student ID, Student first and last name, results, comments, and total number
         of registered Students.} \\
         
         \textbf{Sequence of Actions:}

               comments, and the total number of Students registered]}
         \end{enumerate}

         \textbf{Rational:}
         {\small This allows the Faculty to know the details of an upcoming exam before
         administering it. It is helpful to know how much material to prepare,
         how many Students have registered, etc. beforehand for Faculty.}

            \item The exam data is saved.}
         \end{enumerate}

         \textbf{Rational:}

            \item Faculty member enters exam results.
            \item The exam data is saved. }
         \end{enumerate}

            \item Faculty member is presented the details of the exam selected.}
         \end{enumerate}

         \textbf{Rational:}

      \end{enumerate}

         \textbf{Rational:}
         {\small The Students who participated in an exam will need to know their
         results, but only after the Faculty has graded the exam and reviewed
         it. Hence, the Faculty should have the capability to make the exam
         results available for Student review.}

            \item All Student records are viewable.}
      \end{enumerate}

            \item The Faculty enters the Student record data.
            \item The new Student record is created.}
      \end{enumerate}

         \textbf{Rational:}

            \item Faculty searches Student records by their data.
            \item All Student records that meet the criteria are shown.}
      \end{enumerate}

         \textbf{Rational:}
         {\small Because Faculty should be able to view all Student records, there
         should be an option to search the Records as well.}

               \item Communication Exam Results
               \item Core Course Results
            \end{itemize}
         \item The Student record is updated with the new information.}
      \end{enumerate}

            \item The exam record is updated.}
         \end{enumerate}
