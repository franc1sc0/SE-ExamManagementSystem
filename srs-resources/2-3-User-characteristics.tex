% User Characteristics

There are two type of users \index{user} who will be using the application: Faculty members
and students of the University. Because each group has a different use of the
application, they each have separate requirements. \index{user!requirements}

The faculty members have more functionality within the application because of
their ability to create, edit, and search Student Records and Exams. This means
that the application must be efficient in allowing them to search, update and
view information about students and exams.

The students will use the application only for exam related activities. In this
sense, the application should only allow a student limited functionality to
register, withdraw and view exams.

For both types of users, no previous training \index{user!training} or specialization should be
required beyond interacting with a website in order to use the application
correctly.
