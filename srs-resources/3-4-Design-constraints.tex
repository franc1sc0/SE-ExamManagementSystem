% 3.4 Design constraints 

We will design this program to be as flexible as possible and platform independant.We will implement read
write contraints for the data on the type of user or role. Resources will have to be provided by the client if 
they wish to scale the program further than the tested capacity.There seems not to be other design constraints
imposed on the implementation of this program.
